# example-streamlit-app
This repo contains an example streamlit application code for public depoloyement to Streamlit Community Cloud.
Application developed and deployed by Hüseyin ARSLAN and Enes GÜLER (@GulerEnes) for graduation project which titled "Colorization of Gray-Scale Images and Videos using Deep Learning"

Since our deep learning model was stored on Google Cloud Storage, after our subscription ends we shut down the application.
